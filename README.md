## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add the following environment variables in Vercel:
   - `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Clerk publishable key
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Your backend API URL
4. Deploy!

For detailed instructions, see [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIXED.md](VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIXED.md)

### Backend Deployment

The backend should be deployed to Railway or a similar service:
1. Deploy [backend/server.js](backend/server.js) to Railway
2. Ensure the Railway URL is set as `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
3. Verify CORS is configured to allow requests from your Vercel domain

## Troubleshooting

If you see "Failed to fetch packages from server. Showing demo data." after deployment:

1. Check that your backend is running and accessible
2. Verify the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly
3. Ensure CORS is configured to allow requests from your Vercel domain
4. Check the browser console for detailed error messages

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_POST_FIX.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_POST_FIX.md)
