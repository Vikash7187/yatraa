## 🚀 Deployment Verification

### ✅ Railway Backend
- [ ] Backend is deployed and running
- [ ] Railway URL is accessible: `https://yatraa-production-567e.up.railway.app/`
- [ ] Health check endpoint works: `https://yatraa-production-567e.up.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Packages endpoint works: `https://yatraa-production-567e.up.railway.app/api/packages`

### ✅ Vercel Frontend
- [ ] Frontend is deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Local Testing
- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Test API connection with [test-api-connection.js](test-api-connection.js)
- [ ] Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- [ ] **NEW**: Test that `import.meta.env` is used instead of `process.env`

### ✅ Network Testing
- [ ] Check Railway backend is accessible from external networks
- [ ] Verify CORS headers are properly set
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl or Postman

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

### If Packages Still Not Loading:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify Railway backend URL is correct and accessible
3. Confirm Vercel environment variables are set
4. Check Railway deployment logs for errors
5. Test API endpoints directly in browser

### Network/Connection Issues:
1. Ensure Railway backend is running
2. Check if Railway domain is properly configured
3. Verify firewall settings are not blocking requests
4. Test with a simple curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Origin: https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app" \
        -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
        -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With" \
        -X OPTIONS \
        https://yatraa-production-567e.up.railway.app/api/packages
   ```

### Environment Variable Issues:
1. **"process is not defined" error**: 
   - Ensure you're using `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env` in frontend code
   - Check that all environment variables start with `VITE_` for frontend access
   - Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard

## 📊 Monitoring

### ✅ Health Checks
- [ ] Set up monitoring for Railway backend
- [ ] Configure alerts for downtime
- [ ] Monitor API response times

### ✅ Error Tracking
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for frontend errors
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs for backend errors
- [ ] Set up error reporting if needed

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Packages loading from backend API (not demo data)
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ All environment variables correctly loaded
- ✅ Smooth user experience without loading issues

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Deploy updated backend to Railway
